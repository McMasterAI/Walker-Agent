## Relevant notes

### Basic Rundown

-   Many of the current existing environments for stimulating artificial intelligence have inaccurate physics, low task complexity, a limited capacity for interaction among agents. This study exams the Unity engine as well as the Unity-ML-Agents Toolkit as a means of stimulating artificial intelligence in a complex environment.

### Introduction

-   Video game environments have been found to be a good means to test artificial intelligence algorithms. Many of the challenges humans face to succeed in a video game are the same ones that many artificial intelligence algorithms aim to crack.
-   Most research now is being put into developing effective algorithms and the environment side of it has been neglected, even thought both are critical to developing artificial intelligence technology.

### Anatomy of Environments and Simulators

-   The most essential axes of environmental complexity is sensory, physical, task logic, and social.
-   Sensory such that the AI can detect elemtns of their environment in a meaningful way.
-   Physicial so that the AI can interact with the environment in a meaningful way.
-   Task logic complexity such that the AI can solve increasingly difficult tasks, a hallmark of human intelligence.
-   Social complexity so that agents can interact with eachother in the same way humans have. This also includes different groups of agents interacting with other groups to accomplish specific tasks.

-   The simulation should also be made such that it allows for extremely large sets of data to be computed at once and for it to be extremely configurable.

### Unity

-   Unity is a general platform since it is not restricted to any genre of gameplay or simulation
-   The extensible nature of Unity allows for the use of 3rd-party engines if needed.
-   It is also possible to run Unity simulations without rendering if it is not critical to the
    simulation.

### The Unity-ML-Agents Toolkit

-   The Unity ML-Agents Toolkit is an open source project which enables researchers and developers to create simulated environments using the Unity Editor and interact with them via a Python API.
-   The reward function, used to provide a learning signal to the agent, can be defined or modified at any time during the simulation using the Unity scripting system.
-   Increasing the number of Unity simulations depends on the computational resources available and the complexity of the environment.
